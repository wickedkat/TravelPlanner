Your task is to build a simple Trip Planner application.
It stores Locations, which all have the following common attributes: X and Y coordinates.
All Locations are divided into the following subcategories:

Landmark: This one has a name, and its coordinates can only be set once.
They have an entrance fee that can be set multiple times with validation for negative values.

City: This object also has a name. Its coordinates can only be set once.
It also needs a method that returns all the landmarks in a 50 km distance.

UserLocation: The current location of the user.
This object also stores the coordinates every time it is set and can show the location history of a user.

Furthermore every location has a method that returns the closest city to it (at least known by the trip planner).
Implement the above in an OOP way!

Note: You can assume that the earth is flat, i.e. there is no need to wrap around coordinates.
